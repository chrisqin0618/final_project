# 9001 Final Project – Life Restart Simulator

A Python-based interactive simulation project created as part of the COMP9001/INFO/STAT coursework.  
This project simulates a **“Life Restart”** experience — a player can restart life, make decisions, and observe how different choices affect outcomes such as wealth, health, intelligence, and happiness.

## Project Overview

The **Life Restart Simulator** is a command-line game where the player experiences a simplified life cycle.  
It demonstrates programming fundamentals including:
- Input/output handling  
- Control flow (`if/else`, `while` loops)  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)  
- Randomized event simulation  
- Modular function design  

Players can:
- Choose different life paths (e.g. rich/poor, scholar/artist)
- Make random or deterministic choices  
- View final statistics and outcomes at the end of each simulated life
